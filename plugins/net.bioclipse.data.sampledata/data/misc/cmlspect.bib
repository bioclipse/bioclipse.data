 	 chirality code is a sequence of (typically 100) numbers, being equal to
 	 the value of a certain "chirality function" at equidistant points
 	 within a chosen interval. For molecules of moderate size the chirality
 	 function has thousands of peaks (maxima and minima), one for each
 	 quartet of atoms. Therefore it looks as if the chirality code cannot
 	 provide a faithful representation of the chirality function and thus a
 	 faithful representation of the molecular structure. We now show that
 	 functional groups present in the molecule result in clusters of near-lying
 	 and partially overlapping peaks, whose position in the chirality
 	 code is characteristic for the particular functional group. This
 	 enables a sound structural interpretation of the chirality code.},

    abstract = {Widespread adoption of open-source software for network
 	 infrastructure, web servers, code development, and operating systems leads
 	 one to ask how far it can go. Will ?open source? spread broadly,
 	 or will it be restricted to niches frequented by hopeful hobbyists
 	 and midnight hackers? Here we identify reasons for the success of
 	 open-source software and predict how consumers in drug discovery will
 	 benefit from new open-source products that address their needs with
 	 increased flexibility and in ways complementary to proprietary options.},
